      <h1>Introduction</h1> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Stephen Michael Fusilier, I am programming student at CoderCamps. Beginning what is I'm sure to be a lifelong learning experience; I always enjoy and look forward to new oppotunities to broaden my knowledge</p>
      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began my educational journey at the University of Arizona with Business Management, then returning to my home in Yuma,AZ to study criminal justice. After recieving my A.A.S. in Administration of Justice I took a year off only to return and began Animal Science studies with a brief stint in Accounting at Mesa Community College. I eventually found my way to Pima Medical Institute to take and complete their Veterinary Assisting course. Eventually this path led me to CoderCamps to begin what I can only describe as an exciting journey into programming.</p>
      <h1> Why Programming</h1>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my varied educational background some might wonder how I ended up in programming. Simply put I enjoy a challenge I seek something that challenges me and my active mind. The challenging and ever changing aspects that make up computer programming offer not only a continously challenging subject but help satisfy my thirst for always challenging and growing my education.</p>
